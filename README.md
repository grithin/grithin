# About
I'm a programmer who occasionally tries to introduce something useful.  A lot of these tools I've used in work projects or in personal projects.  Some of them I just designed for the fun of it and they never went into production.  Presently, I'm enjoying building things with the help of JSDOC.  If only every language had such a featureful standard for documenting, then perhaps I'd still know what all the Python, Ruby, Java, and Golang code I wrote does.



# Highlights
- [Service Locator And Dependency Injector](https://github.com/grithin/php-ioc-di) : I introduced a lot of interesting features on this one
- [Application Standard](https://github.com/PHP-SG/psr-102) : A standard for application design that includes middleware and outerware. See [prototype implementation](https://github.com/PHP-SG/sr-2-implementation)
- [PHP DB](https://github.com/grithin/php-db) : An enjoyably complex and flexible database query builder and handler
- [PHP DB Tree](https://github.com/grithin/php-db-tree) : For handling tree data within RDB, like nested comments
- [JS Input Validation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@headhr/conform) : My PHP dynamic validation implemented in async JS
- [Active Record Basis](https://github.com/grithin/php-record) : A way of tracking arbitrarily deep changes to data
- [PHP Templating](https://github.com/grithin/phptemplate) : A featureful template inclusion tool
- [Simple Expression Parser](https://github.com/grithin/simpex?tab=readme-ov-file) : A parser for a langauge for describing example usage
